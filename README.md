Weights are ported from the original models and are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!7RowVLCL!q3cEVRK9jyOSB9el3SssIA). You need `weights_SSD300.hdf5`, `weights_300x300_old.hdf5` is for the old version of architecture with 3x3 convolution for `pool6`.

This code was tested with `Keras` v1.2.2, `Tensorflow` v1.0.0, `OpenCV` v3.1.0-dev
